An idea for an iOS, iPad layout manager that resembles a desktop application. Inspired by an iPad Pro but targetting the iPad platform in general.

The primary goal is to facilitate Prototyping and Proof-Of-Concept style application development as well as building in some sort of TDD functionality.
